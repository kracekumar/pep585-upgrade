# PEP585 Upgrade

This is a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) hook configured to automatically upgrade your type hints
to the new native types implemented in [PEP 585](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0585/).

They are available with any Python version above `3.7`, but if you're below `3.9` you will need to run it with `futures-imports=true`.

A complete list of the newly introduced types are shown below.

### Show me

In a nutshell, this code

```python
from typing import List, Tuple, Dict, Set, FrozenSet

def do_thing(x: List[Tuple[str, ...]], y: Dict[str, Set[str]]) -> FrozenSet:
```

becomes this

```python
def do_thing(x: list[tuple[str, ...]], y: dict[str, set[str]]) -> frozenset:
```

or this, if you enable the futures option

```python
from __future__ import annotations

def do_thing(x: list[tuple[str, ...]], y: dict[str, set[str]]) -> frozenset:
```

### Features:
- [x] Perform in-line substitution for new types
- [x] Add required imports for non-builtin types, when they are replaced in
- [x] Add `__futures__` imports if enabled
- [x] Remove the (now unused) typing imports
- [ ] ~~More complex import handling, sorting, and removal~~

As a small aside; since thorough import handling isn't in the scope of this package,
we would recommend running this in tandem with a hook like `isort` to aggregate
and sort your imports. Otherwise you risk needing to do *some* manual cleanup
from time to time (though it should be pretty rare).

### Config

To use this with [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/), simply add this to your config file:

```yaml
- repo: https://github.com/sondrelg/pep585-upgrade
  rev: master  # or add a specific commit sha
  hooks:
  - id: upgrade-type-hints
    args: [ 'futures=true' ]
```

For more information about available arguments, see the [function definitions](https://github.com/sondrelg/pep585-upgrade/blob/master/src/upgrade_type_hints/update.py#L95).

### Running this once

If you wish to run this once on your codebase, that's not easy to do *without* pre-commit, as it piggybacks on that process quite a bit.

However, installing pre-commit and configuring the hook to run will take you less than a minute. These are the steps:

- Run `pip install pre-commit`
- Run `touch pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Copy the configuration shown above into the file
- Run `pre-commit run --all-files`
